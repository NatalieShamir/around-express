# Around the U.S. Back End

## Description

This project is the first in a series of projects designed to implement back-end technologies and techniques for front-end developers. It examplifies building your own API, creating a project structure and working with files.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.

## Directories

`/data` — JSON files to temporarily emulate database integration.

`/routes` — routing files.

All other directories are optional and may be created by the developer if necessary.
